                            <h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
							<p>
                                This case study showcases my journey in transforming Atom2Atom, an app that goes beyond digitized periodic tables. It not only delivers detailed atomic properties but also enables seamless comparisons.
							</p>	
							<p>
								Building on the foundation of<a href="https://youtu.be/MW6rTOXO_v0?si=kFKHyCQM6bNMxXSj"><mark> Kalkulator Atom</mark></a>, which was a class project I did with my friends, this upgraded version addresses the challenge of standing out in a sea of similar apps. Through research-driven design enhancements, I optimized the layout for clarity to make exploring and comparing atoms more intuitive and engaging.
                            </p>

                            <h4><strong>What is Atom2Atom? &#x1F52C;</strong></h4>
								<p>
									Atom2Atom is an app that can provide you with information about properties of atom and lets you compare it.
								</p>

							<h4><strong>Problem with the previous app &#128681;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								The old interface did its job, but there were a few hiccups. Plus, while the button shape was unique, it didn’t quite align with the look and feel I wanted to achieve. The font size was too small, and the font style made it harder to read, affecting clarity.
							</p>

							<h4><strong>The goal &#127919;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								My goal is to elevate the app's interface, making it more user-friendly, visually appealing, and functional.

                        <article id="discovery">
                            <h2><strong>Discovery</strong></h2>
							<p>
								To guide the redesign process, I conducted <strong>secondary/desk research</strong> and <strong>interview</strong> with 5	 people who have used a periodic table app (or a similar app) and those who have never used this type of app before.
							</p>
                        </article>

                        <article id="define">
                            <h2><strong>Defining the Findings</strong></h2>

							<h4><strong>Desk Research &#128194;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								From my desk research, I discovered similar apps with thousands of downloads, highlighting the popularity and utility of this type of tool. Many of these apps commonly use a dark color palette paired with bright accent colors, setting a design trend in the space. 
							</p>
							
							<h4><strong>Affinity Diagram &#128203;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								To identify key insights from the interviews, I created an <a href="images/Atom2Atom/A2A-AffinityDiagram.png"><mark>Affinity Diafram</mark></a> to organize the feedback effectively. The findings revealed that users found the inconsistent font styles and small font size challenging to read. While some appreciated the color palette, others felt it was too dark. Additionally, the button shapes didn’t resonate with users, and they suggested incorporating more graphics to enhance the app's visual appeal.

							<h4><strong>User Persona &#129485;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								Then, to gain a deeper understanding of my target audience and ensure the design aligns with their needs, I created User Persona. To illustrate how users interact with and navigate through the app, I created a comprehensive user flow. It maps out the steps users take, from launching the app to achieving their end goal of comparing atomic properties, providing a clear understanding of their journey.

                            <h2><strong>The Redesign Process</strong></h2>

                            <img id="box" src="images/Atom2Atom/Wireframe.png" alt="Low fidelity wireframe" width="100%">
                            <h4><strong>Low to Mid-Fidelity Wireframes &#128196;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								At the start of the redesign process, I began by sketching a rough wireframe with pencil and paper. I then refined it into a simple black-and-white wireframe on Figma, focusing on the layout and structure rather than the colors.
							</p>

                            <img id="box" src="images/Atom2Atom/ColorPalette-Thumbnail.png" alt="Color Palette" width="100%">

                            <h4><strong>Color palette &#127880;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								For the color palette, I drew inspiration from the hydrogen emission spectrum, incorporating pink, lime, and purple-blue into the design. These colors were chosen to create contrast against the black background, addressing feedback from an interviewee who suggested balancing the dark theme. The grey-white tones were carefully selected to maintain visibility against the background while ensuring a comfortable and strain-free viewing experience for users.

                            <h4><strong>Hi-Fi Wireframe: Main Screen &#128241;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								The previous interface was rigid and contained excessive white space.Additionally, having two search buttons was unnecessary, and the fact that users had to manually type in the name of the atom they wanted to compare made the process tedious. Therefore, I have decided to make several changes to the interface. These include increasing the font-size and replacing the two search buttons with a single button.
							</p>

                            <img id="box" src="images/Atom2Atom/ListOfAtom.gif" alt="Old and new design comparisons" width="100%">

                            <h4><strong>Hi-Fi Wireframe: List of Atom Screen &#128466;</strong></h4>
							<p>
								In the previous design, the back button took up too much space, and the placement of the text seemed off. I decided to turn the list layout into a medium-sized icon. This not only makes the appearance more interesting, but also gives the opportunity to include extra information about the atom. I also changed the back button into a simple arrow and cleaned up the overall layout to make the screen look cleaner.

                        <article id="test">
                            <h2><strong>User Testing</strong></h2>
							<p>After conducting usability testing with the same individuals I previously interviewed, I observed them interacting with the prototype and collected their feedback on the redesign. The results were overwhelmingly positive—everyone preferred the redesigned interface over the old version, and all successfully completed the tasks I assigned.</p> 
                                
                            <p>However, while observing their interactions, I noticed a subtle issue they didn’t mention: they struggled slightly when trying to view an atom’s details. It often took them 3 to 4 attempts to click the three-dot icon correctly. To resolve this, I made some tweaks to the design by increasing the clickable area, improving overall usability. After the update, users were able to access the details in just one or two attempts, significantly enhancing their experience.</p>

							<h2><strong>What's next?</strong></h2>
							<p>I realize that UX design isn’t a linear process—it’s a continuous cycle of feedback and refinement, evolving alongside advancements in technology that inevitably shape user needs. As user needs change over time, so must the design. That’s why I genuinely welcome your feedback. Your insights are invaluable and will help me further refine and improve my designs.</p>
